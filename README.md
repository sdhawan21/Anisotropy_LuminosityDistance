#Constraints on the Anisotropy of cosmological parameters
## Repository with the code to run on the data

### Notes (S.D.): I've currently only added the plots and the python scripts. The JLA files are a little large and I didn't want to make the push slow (not sure thats a big problem but the tarball can easily be unpacked)

##TO-DO (for Suhail): Make an instruction list for how to easily take the code and unpack the files for running
